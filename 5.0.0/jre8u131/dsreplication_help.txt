[appuser@6eb89be32f63 bin]$ ./dsreplication --help; ./dsreplication configure --help
This utility can be used to configure replication between servers so that the
data of the servers is synchronized.  For replication to work you must first
enable replication using the 'enable' subcommand and then initialize the
contents of one of the servers with the contents of the other using the
'initialize' subcommand

Usage:  dsreplication {subcommand} {options}

Available subcommands:

configure
    Updates the configuration of the servers to replicate the data under the
    specified base DN.  If one of the specified servers is already replicating
    the data under the base DN with other servers, executing this subcommand
    will update the configuration of all the servers (so it is sufficient to
    execute the command line once for each server we add to the replication
    topology)

initialize
    Initialize the contents of the data under the specified base DN on the
    destination server with the contents on the source server.  This operation
    is required after enabling replication in order replication to work
    ('initialize-all' can also be used for this purpose)

initialize-all
    Initialize the contents of the data under the specified base DN on all the
    servers whose contents are being replicated with the contents on the
    specified server.  This operation is required after enabling replication
    for replication to work ('initialize' applied to each server can also be
    used for this purpose)

post-external-initialization
    This subcommand must be called after initializing the contents of all the
    replicated servers using the tool import-ldif or the binary copy method.
    You must specify the list of base DNs that have been initialized and you
    must provide the credentials of any of the servers that are being
    replicated.  See the usage of the subcommand 'pre-external-initialization'
    for more information

pre-external-initialization
    This subcommand must be called before initializing the contents of all the
    replicated servers using the tool import-ldif or the binary copy method.
    You must specify the list of base DNs that will be initialized and you must
    provide the credentials of any of the servers that are being replicated.
    After calling this subcommand, initialize the contents of all the servers
    in the topology (use the same LDIF file/binary copy on each of the
    servers), then call the subcommand 'post-external-initialization'

purge-historical
    Launches a purge processing of the historical informations stored in the
    user entries by replication. Since this processing may take a while, you
    must specify the maximum duration for this processing.

reset-change-number
    Re-synchronizes the change-log changenumber on one server with the
    change-log changenumber of another.

resume
    Resumes replication on the specified server

status
    Displays a list with the basic replication configuration of the base DNs of
    the servers defined in the registration information.  If no base DNs are
    specified as parameter the information for all base DNs is displayed

suspend
    Suspends (pauses) replication on the specified server

unconfigure
    Unconfigures replication on the specified server for the provided base DN
    and removes references in the other servers with which it is replicating
    data


The global options are:

-b, --baseDn {baseDN}
    Base DN of the data to be replicated, initialized or for which we want to
    unconfigure replication.  Multiple base DNs can be provided by using this
    option multiple times
-w, --adminPassword {bindPassword}
    The global administrator password
-j, --adminPasswordFile {bindPasswordFile}
    The file containing the password of the global administrator
--displayCommand
    Display the equivalent non-interactive argument in the standard output when
    this command is run in interactive mode
--commandFilePath {path}
    The full path to the file where the equivalent non-interactive commands
    will be written when this command is run in interactive mode
--connectTimeout {timeout}
    Maximum length of time (in milliseconds) that can be taken to establish a
    connection.  Use '0' to specify no time out
    Default value: 30000

Configuration Options

--advanced

LDAP connection options:

-I, --adminUid {adminUID}
    User ID of the Global Administrator to use to bind to the server.  For the
    'enable' subcommand if no Global Administrator was defined previously for
    none of the server the Global Administrator will be created using the
    provided data.
    Default value: admin

    existing certificate as server certificate
-u, --keyStorePasswordFile {keyStorePasswordFile}
    Certificate key store PIN file.  A PIN is required when you specify to use
    an existing certificate as server certificate

    SSL-based connections or performing StartTLS negotiation

Utility input/output options:

    arguments
--noPropertiesFile
    No properties file will be used to get default command line argument values

General options:

-?, -H, --help
    Display this usage information

Usage:  dsreplication  {options} configure {options}
Updates the configuration of the servers to replicate the data under the
specified base DN.  If one of the specified servers is already replicating the
data under the base DN with other servers, executing this subcommand will
update the configuration of all the servers (so it is sufficient to execute the
command line once for each server we add to the replication topology)


Global Options:
    See "dsreplication --help"

SubCommand Options:
-h, --host1 {host}
    Fully qualified host name or IP address of the first server whose contents
    will be replicated

    If not specified the global administrator will be used to bind
    Default value: cn=Directory Manager
--bindPassword1 {bindPassword}
    Password to use to bind to the first server whose contents will be
    replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the first server the password
    of the global administrator will be used to bind
--bindPasswordFile1 {bindPasswordFile}
    File containing the password to use to bind to the first server whose
    contents will be replicated.  If no bind DN was specified for the first
    server the password of the global administrator will be used to bind
